I’m Melody Li, a research assistant at [Mila – Quebec AI Institute.](https://mila.quebec/en) I am currently working with [Prof. Taylor Webb](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WCmrJoQAAAAJ&hl=en) to study the emergence of symbolic reasoning in language models. Previously, I worked with [Prof. Blake Richards](https://sites.google.com/mila.quebec/linc-lab/team/blake?authuser=0) and [Prof. Guillaume Lajoie](https://guillaumelajoie.com/) on tracing the representation geometry of language models.

Broadly, I’m interested in developing neural language systems and deeply understanding their inner workings. My research aims to uncover how large language models learn and represent information, integrating ideas from linguistics, cognitive science, neuroscience, and learning dynamics.

I recently graduated from [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/about/history), where I majored in Computer Science and completed double minors in Statistics and Interdisciplinary Life Sciences.

Outside of research, I enjoy reading, playing the piano, and building puzzles and LEGO sets. Feel free to reach out to me!
